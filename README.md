# API Scraping - Web Scraping

The real estate website can be found [here](https://www.realtor.ca/) .

In this project, a dataset _(for Excel & PostgreSQL Database)_ was created by performing **API Scraping-Web Scraping** on a real estate website in Canada.


The address of the property, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the number of car parks, the sizes of the house, the name and number of the agency, and the price of the house are all included in the dataset.
